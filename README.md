# QuartilesSolver

Quartiles is a game on Apple News+.

You are given a set of 20 tiles, each word substrings from 2-4 characters long.
The goal is to combine them to find as many words as possible, including each of
the 5 words that use a unique combination of 4 tiles each.

Because I enjoyed the daily challenge of the game, I thought I would suck all
the frustration (and thus enjoyment) out of it by automating its solution.
